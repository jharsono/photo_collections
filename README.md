# Photo Collections
Photo Collections is built in Django and uses the Unsplash API for viewing and saving High Resolution images.

# Motivation
I built this project to showcase my skills in Django and AJAX calls to an API that I had never used before.

# Feature Summary
Users can search the Unsplash database and select photos to save to a collection. They can access the collection and to edit or view the photos in slideshow mode. 

# Future Features
* Hulu/Netflix Style navigation for your collections
* Carousel or Grid view of collection images
* Control over slideshow settings: Timings, transitions, etc.
